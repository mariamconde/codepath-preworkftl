## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I looked up information about Math Random for javascript on www.w3schools.com. I also used the website to find different background colors for the CSS file.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The first difficult task I experienced was using Glitch.com itself because I am unfamiliar with it, but as I continued to follow the guide I began to understand. Another challenge I faced was being unfamiliar with some of the HTML concepts. I am currently taking my first web development course, therefore I am still learning and not completely fluent in the language. However, I believe this challenge was necessary because I learned a lot by doing this project and retained new information that I will most likely learn in the future. Throughout this project, I also realized how important it is to pay attention to detail because there were many parts I almost missed. I took my time to read the guide and work on the code to actually understand each part of the game being bulit. Lastly, I had a bit of trouble with creating a new pattern for each game. Although this was an optional feature, I encountered a few issues while writing the code for this because it is in javascript. At one point, the memory game was not even functioning. I finally realized that I was missing a semicolon and the game finally worked! All in all, I really enjoyed working on this project no matter the difficulties I encountered.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this project I had a few questions about web development such as: How long does it usually take to write code for a simple game such as this memory game? I was given a guide and it took me about 11 hours to complete therefore I am wondering what the process is like. When web developing a game like this one do developers usually work in teams or is this an individual project? Another question I have is related to the coding aspect: When do you embed CSS or JS in HTML? Is this for simple projects that do not require many parts?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would include all of the optional features to make the game more interesting. Another thing I would like to add is a level bar, this would let you know which level you are on while playing. I think keeping track of levels will make it much more encouraging for the player to remember and repeat the pattern in order to win. Additionally, I would have included a button that shows the attempts remaining for one of the optional features I chose. I think this is better that the alert because the player can see how many mistakes they have left to make in order to win. Lastly, a feature I think would enhance the game is a “lifesaver” feature, this is common in a lot of games where a player has a chance to play again in case they lose the game. I thought this would be a cool feature to add because while playing the light and sound memory game I made a small mistake and would have to start all over. However, the player would only have one extra life for each game played.]
